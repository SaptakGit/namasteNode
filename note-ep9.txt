Asunchronout I/O and non-Blocking I/O is only done in libuv

   --> Event Loop:  (Timer --> Poll --> Check --> Close)
          Event Loop Phase
            Timer:
                1st Timer.All the callbacks that are set by setTimeout or setInterview or any timer callbacks, are executed. It is first prioratise the timer callbacks.
            Poll:
                After Timer Poll.In the poll phase all the callbacks that are associated with I/O are executed. API Calles, data, fs,crypto, http.get, incoming connections. Moset of the callbacks are executed here.
            Check:
                After Poll Check.In this check phase, all the callbacks that are set by setImmediate will be executed.
            Close:
                After Check Close.In this phase all the close operation happen. suppose a socket is open it will close here.

            Before ecah Phase Event Loop run one internal loop cycle. of two phase. 
                process.nextTick()
                promise callbacks

            before executing ecah phase Event Loop execute this small cycle. It is the priority que. All the phases small and main have their separate Queues.

                           Priority Que
                        
                      --> process.nextTick() --

                            Event Loop

                           --- Check <---


            Execution Steps
                process.nextTick()
                promise callbacks
                Timer
                process.nextTick()
                promise callbacks
                Poll
                process.nextTick()
                promise callbacks
                Check
                process.nextTick()
                promise callbacks
                Close
            This cycle wil runs again and again in a loop.

            If Event Loop is Idle, i.e all the pahse is empty then Event Loop is waits at the Poll phase. Whenever it has something it started to loop again. After Idle the Event Loop starts again from Poll Phase.
             Poll --> Check --> Close --> Timer
            If all the Callbcak Queues are empty and there is a Timer going on for suppose 5 seconds, event loop calculates how much time did it have to wait in poll phase, and waits that much time in poll phase, and start running again after 5 seconds.

            Event Loop of browser is different from Event Loop of node. The Event Loop of browser always keep running.
            One Cycle of Event Loop is called a Tick.
            Additional Phase of Event Loop
                - Pending callbacks => executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration
                - idle, prepare => only used internally

                According to the Documentation the Cycle is :

                 ---> timer --> pending callbacks --> idle, prepare --> poll --> check --> close --|
                |                                                                                  |
